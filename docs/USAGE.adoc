== Name

systing - a tracing tool for generating perfetto traces

== Synopsis

*systing* [_OPTIONS_]

== Description

systing is a tracing tool for generating perfetto traces of the system.
It was written with the intention of being a simple and easy to use tool for generating https://perfetto.dev[Perfetto] traces with the least amount of configuration possible.
It is opinionated about what is the most useful information to get out of the system for doing low level system performance investigations.

== Examples

Trace all the scheduling events and stack traces for all threads in the system for 60 seconds:
---
# systing --duration 60
---

Trace only a qemu process and record every time it calls `v9fs_create`
---
# systing --duration 60 --trace-event "usdt:/usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64:qemu:v9fs_create" --trace-event-pid <pid>
---

== Options

=== *--cgroup* _PATH_

Record only processes that belong to this cgroup.
This can be specified multiple times to record multiple cgroups.

With this option we will still record processes that are not in the cgroup but that wakeup a process in our cgroup.
This creates odd artifacts in the scheduler tracks but is useful for debugging.

=== *--cpu-frequency*

Record the CPU frequency of every CPU in the system.
When this is enabled systing will record the CPU frequency of every CPU in the system every 100ms.
This will be added a global track per-CPU in the trace.

=== *--cpu-sched-stats*

Record individual CPU scheduling statistics per CPU and per thread.
This generates a lot of data and is not recommended for long traces.
This will generate 2 tracks in the global track for each CPU in the system.
The first will contain the number of entities in the runqueue for each CPU at the given timestamp.
The second is the current wakeup latency for this CPU at the given timestamp.

=== *--duration*

Specifies the duration of the trace in seconds.

=== *--no-stack-traces*

Do not record stack traces for the threads in the system.
This disables the perf style stack traces as well as the uninterruptible sleep stack traces.

=== *--perf-counter* _COUNTERNAME_

Record a perf counter for the given process.
This can be specified multiple times to record multiple perf counters.
This also accepts a glob pattern to match multiple perf counters.
The perf counters are global tracks and recorded per CPU, so if you wish to view the counters for a particlar section of a thread runtime you must find the CPU that thread is on at the given time and look for the counters on the track for that CPU.

=== *--pid* _PID_

Record only the process with the given PID.
Similar to cgroup, we will record any process that wakes up our PID, which may result in odd artifacts in the scheduler tracks.
This can be specified multiple times to record multiple PIDs.

=== *--process-sched-stats*

Record individual process scheduling statistics per CPU and per thread.
This is similar to *--cpu-sched-stats* but for each thread in the system.
This generates a lot of data and is not recommended for long traces.
This will generate a single track per thread that shows that threads current scheudling wakeup latency.

=== *--ringbuf-size-mb* _SIZE_

Specifies the size of the ring buffer in megabytes.
The default is 50Mib.
If you are having too many missed events you can increase this size.
NOTE: You will always have missed events for perf events, this is normal.
Only increase this if you are having misseed sched events, as that affects the trace quality.

=== *--sw-event"

If recording inside of a VM, this can be specified to enable the software events necessary to record stack traces.

=== *--trace-event* _EVENT_

This is a special option that takes a format similar to https://bpftrace.org[`bpftrace`].
Currently the supported events are only `usdt`, `uprobe`, and `uretprobe`.
If using the userspace related events you must also specify *--trace-event-pid* to specify the PID of the process you want to trace.
The following is an exhaustive list of the supported formats

* `usdt:/path/to/executable:tracepoint_name:tracepoint_class`
* `uprobe:/path/to/executable:function_name`
* `uprobe:/path/to/executable:offset`
* `uprobe:/path/to/executable:function_name+offset`
* `uretprobe:/path/to/executable:function_name`
* `uretprobe:/path/to/executable:offset`
* `uretprobe:/path/to/executable:function_name+offset`

=== *--trace-event-pid* _PID_

This is to be paired with *--trace-event-pid*.
Any _PID_ specified here will have any of the userspace trace events specified applied to it.
